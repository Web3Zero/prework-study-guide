# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide was built as a place to compile notes on my learnings on how to do some basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
I am motivated to learn full stack development.
I built this project as it gave me an intro into HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. 
The by-product of building the prework study guide is I am learning, and now I also have a helpful prework study guide!
I learned that there is SO much to learn, wow. I has been very interesting for me to see the relationship of how code is worked on locally (and tested), then pushed, pulled and merged into a main branch. Also starting to learn some really basic features of JavaScript has been particularly interesting. It has given me a greater appreciation for what I see developers have built and deployed in the real world.

## Usage

The prework study guide is a central location for me to review my study notes. Some are notes suggested to be added by the coursework but some I added myself. I took a lot of notes especially for the Git section, as there are many commands I have not yet committed to memory. 
You can also open the dev tools to see the JavaScript running, and the random function we coded will give you a random topic to study. It will also help show any bugs in the code.
